# Airline-Ticket-Booking-Project
This is a simple airline ticket booking project (without login) in C language
* Here I use many header file just for my easiness and to upgrade it in future
* When you run the program using any IDE
* You come across two options asking for the class of seat and then other preferences
* It generates your ticket and updates seat record
